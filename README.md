## General Information

Meals for Today generates a random group of meals that can be consumed throughout the day. Each time the function is run, a new day's worth of meals is generated for you, so that you can remove the hassle of deciding on what to eat for the entire day.

## Features

Currently Meals for Today has 15 different meals for each sub category (breakfast, lunch, and dinner) for which meals will be randomly generated from. These sets of meals can be updated and altered at any time and the function will take into account these changes.

## Project Status

Meals for Today is still in the development phase and will add further functionalities down the line.

## Room for Improvement

- Take an input for a type of meal and place into the respective objects (breakfast, lunch, and dinner)
- Take into account some other options from other meal types (e.g., You can eat breakfast food for lunch and the function will generate, which breakfast you should eat as well)

## Acknowledgements

Meals for Today is based on the projects "Mixed Messages" from Codecademy's full stack web development curriculum.
